gateway-device
==============

The gateway device is the interface between proprietary, simple ISM-band radio devices and the IP world of the Internet. We've chosen to use Node-RED for prototyping at least because it makes the project much more accessible. 

There is something to be said for stability and simplicity, so if you find yourself hankering for a simply Python parser then have a look at the alternative [pi_sensor_mqtt](https://github.com/OxFloodNet/pi_sensor_mqtt) which will satisfy you beyond measure.
